This project aims to develop a simple, functional vending machine simulator using Python programming. The vending machine program allows users to interact with a console-based interface to select products, view prices, insert money, and receive change. Key functionalities include a user-friendly menu system, error handling for invalid inputs, inventory management, and dynamic calculation of balances. The program uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to design the vending machineâ€™s components, such as products, payment systems, and inventory.
